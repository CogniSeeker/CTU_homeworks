### 1: Sum of cubes calculator for a given range

Takes two integer inputs, 'a' and 'b', and calculates the sum of cubes of numbers in the range from 'a' to 'b' (inclusive).

### 2: Binary search-based logarithm calculator

Given a positive number 'y,' the program calculates its logarithm base 2 using the binary search method.

### 3: Caesar cipher decryption

Decrypts a list of integer pairs using the Caesar cipher decryption algorithm and outputs the corresponding characters represented by the decrypted integers.

### 4: Finding longest common subsequences

Given a list of integers, the program identifies subsequences occurring at two different positions within the list and outputs the length of the longest such subsequence along with the starting positions of these occurrences.

### 5: Identifying longest contiguous sequence

Reads an array of integers from a file and finds where in this array the longest contiguous sequence of even numbers in the diagonal direction is located.

### 6: Determining winning move in Tic-Tac-Toe

Reads a tic-tac-toe board and determines the coordinates of the winning move for the player on the turn.

### 7: Recursive solution for placing Ubongo figures

**Description:** Reads input data consisting of a matrix and a list of Ubongo figures and recursively finds a solution by placing the figures in the matrix, using different rotations for each figure, and outputs the resulting filled matrix.

### 8: Analyzing light and dark cycles in TRAX game

**Description:** Simulates a game similar to TRAX by analyzing a given field configuration to find the number of light and dark cycles and their respective maximum lengths.

### 9: BFS algorithm for finding a path for a horse on a board from start to end

**Description:** Reads a 2D matrix representing a board with obstacles and uses the BFS algorithm to find a path for a horse (knight) to move from the start position to the end position on the board.

### 10: Simple RSA encryption

**Description:** Implements a basic RSA encryption algorithm, where the user inputs a text message, and the program encrypts it using the provided RSA public key (n, e) and returns the encrypted cipher.

### 11: Finding closest point and circumference

**Description:** Calculates the closest point to the center of gravity of a set of points and identifies a point on the circumference of the smallest circle containing exactly half of the points, then prints the indices of these two points in the original list.
